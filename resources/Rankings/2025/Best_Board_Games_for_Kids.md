## **What is a Kids Game exactly?**

Kid Games are a category of board games that means a few things. They often all:

* Are intended players somewhere between 4-8 years of age (older players can of course enjoy them, too!)
* Have simple, easy to learn rules
* Take around 15-30 minutes or less to play
* Are designed so kids are able to play independently with only minor help if at all from adults

## Best Board Games for Kids Ages 4-8

## [10. The Sandcastles of Burgundy](https://amzlink.to/az04AJDamlAel)

The Sandcastles of Burgundy takes the incredibly popular strategy board game for adults and reimagines it for children. Created by the same designer, this Feld for Kids game packs hidden depth into an adorable theme. Players are looking for the decorations queen crab wants. During the game kids are presented with simple yet impactful choices, memory challenges, and a lovely step into the world of modern strategy gaming. Ages 5+

## 9. **[Mmm!](https://amzlink.to/az02AtYO1H6up)**

Mmm! is a cooperative dice game where kids work together as mischievous mice stealing snacks before the cat catches them. The tension ramps up just enough to keep everyone invested without ever feeling stressful. Teamwork is key, and kids love cheering each other on. It’s charming, replayable, and a challenge to win. Adam’s even played this one solo on his own; he enjoyed it so much. Ages 5+

## 8. **[Ziggurat](https://amzlink.to/az0pSkgnxBjJ7)**

Ziggurat is a tense cooperative legacy campaign where you and your teammate climb an ancient temple filled with secrets, danger, and story moments that unfold over six sessions. Each chapter permanently changes the game — new rules appear, the map shifts, and your past decisions shape what comes next. The legacy system makes every play feel meaningful, with surprises that transform the adventure in unexpected ways. With only six chapters, it is the perfect first legacy game for families with younger kids. Ages 6+

## 7. **[Foxy](https://amzlink.to/az0hKrahh0P56)**

Foxy takes the idea of a classic memory game and gives it a smart twist where everyone stays equally involved. Instead of simply finding pairs, kids have to watch, predict, and make thoughtful choices. There’s no lucking out because someone flipped your perfect tile for you. It’s fast, fair, and a huge step up from standard memory games. You can even play a full game with us by watching our [YouTube playthrough](https://thetabletopfamily.com/play-along-learn-and-play-foxy-at-home/). Ages 6+

As they get more comfortable, the advanced rules let you scale difficulty at the perfect pace. It’s a fantastic introduction to resource-building games. Ages 6+

## The TOP 5 Kids Games of 2025

Each of these games were honestly incredible and I could make a case for why each is the best of the year for kids games. They have been games that not only our children have loved this year, but also the games I have gotten the happiest of responses from our audience who have written to tell me how much their kids (and they!) have loved playing them.

## 2. [**Mr. Postmouse’s Picnic**](https://amzlink.to/az0d3AwsTb6lJ)

Mr. Post Mouse is an adorable delivery adventure where kids race around the map helping charming animal friends get their mail. The artwork is irresistibly cute, making the whole experience feel like stepping into a storybook. It’s easy for young players to follow, but still engaging for grown-ups.

## 1. **[Cascadia Junior](https://amzlink.to/az0ehFZfAGidw)**

Cascadia Junior streamlines the award-winning original into a quick, gentle puzzle perfect for younger players. Better than I ever could have expected, Cascadia Junior streamlines the complex gameplay of the original into a strategic yet inviting game that players as young as 5 can enjoy with beautiful, storybook quality art and intentional child-focused design. Kids will love placing animals and building habitats, while adults will appreciate how easy it is to teach and scale the game’s difficulty up for older players while keeping it simplified for the youngest. The simplified scoring still feels rewarding and clever. It’s a fantastic “first strategy game” that families can enjoy together. Ages 6+ (younger with some help)
