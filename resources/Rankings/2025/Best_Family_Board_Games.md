### What is a Family Game exactly?

Family Games are a category of board games that means a few things. They often all:

Play well with players ages 8-10+  
Have simple, easy to learn rules  
Take around 60 minutes or less to play

One of the most common misconceptions of a family game is that the age indicates that it is not for adults. On the contrary, these games can be enjoyed by both adult-only groups and mixed age groups of both kids and adults. Games in this category are often the best games you’ll find, they focus on fun mechanics, engaging themes, and do not overstay their welcome. Here are games we enjoyed best at our family game nights.

## 15. Jungo

Jungo is a fantastic alternative to *Scout* that offers the same “don’t rearrange your hand” thrill, but with rules the whole family can learn in minutes. Turns move fast, combos feel great, and it encourages lots of clever card timing. Kids and adults get hooked equally quickly. It’s snappy, addictive, and endlessly replayable.

## 14. Star Wars Super Teams

We honestly didn’t expect much from Star Wars Super Teams and then we proceeded to have a blast! This game is a lively, family-friendly race where you’re trying to get your squad’s ships across the finish line. The twist? Sometimes you must move the *other* team’s ships, creating delicious “Do I really have to do this?” moments. Timing becomes everything as you try to help yourself without helping them. It’s fast, thematic, and a perfect team game for mixed ages. No Star Wars knowledge required to enjoy this surprise hit.

## 13. Positano

Positano is a relaxing, beautiful game that feels like a sunny vacation on the Italian coast. But beneath the calm vibe lies a surprisingly cutthroat world of property management and clever timing. Every choice affects the landscape and the competition. It’s both scenic and strategic in exactly the right amounts.

## 12. Bonsai

Bonsai is a serene puzzle that invites players to grow their own tiny tree. It’s quiet, thoughtful, and surprisingly rewarding. Every tile added feels like crafting a miniature work of art. As your tree comes together, there’s a real sense of pride and anticipation. It’s a game that brings out calm smiles and satisfied nods around the table.

Flip 7 is a push-your-luck showdown where the table gleefully roots for someone to bust. The race to 200 points keeps the tension high and the decisions spicy. Every flip feels like a gamble, and every victory feels earned. It’s the kind of game that makes the whole family chant “One more card!” (Did we put this at #7 on purpose? You be the judge.)

This cooperative trick-taking game brilliantly captures the story of the Fellowship in a way both LOTR fans and card-game lovers will appreciate. Every hand feels like a shared challenge against looming danger. Working together to stay alive creates great table tension. It’s clever, thematic, and the progressive campaign will have you saying “let’s play one more round”. One of our favorite game experiences of 2025 was an extended game session, where we played this game round after round. Our top cooperative game of 2025.
