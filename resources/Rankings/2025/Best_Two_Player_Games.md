I love a two player board game — they’re perfect for a fun, playful, competitive game between you and your spouse, your kids, or just your favorite player number two. There were a bunch of great two player board games that released this year, so much so that they deserved their own Best of the Year list!

## [10. Spirits of the Wild: Awakening](https://amzlink.to/az03Jxb3gA2Ur)

Spirits of the Wild: Awakening leans into its relaxing, tactile heart—drawing stones from the bag, placing them onto your animal boards, and watching your tableau slowly come to life. The refreshed 2025 version adds new spirit animals, fresh powers, and expanded ways to score, giving the game a warm sense of discovery without losing its easy, peaceful flow. Even with its cozy tone, the gentle back-and-forth of timing special abilities or snagging key stones adds just the right touch of tension. It’s a lovely two-player retreat that feels calm in the hands and quietly satisfying on the table.

## [9. Everdell Duo](https://amzlink.to/az0Ja7Kc6GFdv)

Everdell Duo takes the beloved woodland charm of Everdell and distills it into a tight, focused two-player experience. Every decision matters, making the tension between players feel rich and rewarding. You’ll constantly be weighing short-term gains against long-term plans. It’s warm, thematic, and beautifully competitive. Most importantly, it feels different enough to justify owning this in addition to Everdell, which already plays great at two.

Simple rules, clever gameplay, and loads of personality make it a fantastic two-player treat.

## [5. Garden Rush](https://amzlink.to/az00bOx4bw5fK)

Garden Rush is a fast, scrappy tile placement draft where you’re trying to not only complete your shape patterns in your garden, but time their drafting to do so properly.

Special powers keep interactions sharp and lively as players race to grow and harvest their vegetables. Games fly by, yet still pack in real tactical depth. It’s a perfect “let’s play again” two-player experience.

## [4. Solstis](https://amzlink.to/az0KsxtSSENjJ)

Solstis is a cozy drafting and tile placement duel that feels calm at first until the spite drafting begins. The choices are simple but surprisingly impactful, leading to those fun “I can’t believe you took that!” moments. It strikes a lovely balance between relaxed puzzling and sharp competitive play. Perfect for date nights when you want something gentle with a tiny bit of spice.

## [2. The Architects of Amytis](https://amzlink.to/az07mKIvwQ6op)

The Architects of Amytis blends drafting and city building into a smooth head to head puzzle full of clever decisions. The hidden tic-tac-toe bonus system adds a surprising layer of strategic sneakiness. Every round feels like a tense dance between planning your own build and trying to disrupt your opponent.

## [1. Toy Battle](https://amzlink.to/az077TMiXjwyW)

Toy Battle is a game that just stood out to us for all the right reason! It combines incredible war-like tactical game play with a fun toy theme that feels whimsical and nostalgic all at once. It manages to be both cute and cunning as players go head to head to take control of their opponent’s base by sending out toy troops to battle. Each toy has a unique power and you’ll utilize them to the best of your ability to see your goal through. The game comes with multiple maps to add a ton of variety and challenge from game to game. Toy Battle has been our most played board game this year by all members of our family and the one you’re most likely to come across our 8-11 year old boys playing together on their own.
