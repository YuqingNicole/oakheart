En fait, au départ, il s’agit pour Jean-Jacques DERGHAZARIAN et Michel PINON de faire découvrir leur dernière création commune : « LE MOT LE PLUS COURT » ; ça commence par la présentation d’une maquette du jeu à l’occasion du festival « AVALANCHE DE JEUX » à Val d’Isère au mois de Juillet 2009, festival pour créateurs de jeux et pendant lequel le jeu se rôde auprès d’un public enthousiaste. Ainsi l’idée de réaliser une autoédition fait son chemin avec la volonté que ce jeu de lettres puisse être accessible à un large public, allant des plus jeunes aux plus âgés. Les amis se lancent alors dans l’aventure pour relever ce défi et 3JM-Edition voit le jour!
