## 1. If you have 3D artwork, we will make a 3D sample in a week and ship it to you for your confirmation. Then we will open the molds (in a month) and make a pre-production sample(PPS) in 3~5 days for your confirmation. Finally, we will arrange the mass production and color them.

## 2. If you can only provide photos, we provide 2 options for you:

* ## 1. We will draw STL files which is expensive and fine;
* ## 2. Prototype which is cheap and less fine.

## Then we will make a 3D sample, open molds, make a pre-production sample, mass production, and coloring.

## 3. For incoming samples, we will copy them by making a PU sample, open molds, making pre-production samples, mass production, and coloring.

## The cost of custom plastic miniatures consists of two parts: the mold charge and the product cost.

## 1. Mold Charge

## The cost of the molding depends on the complexity of your miniature. So, we need to confirm the price according to your artwork. If necessary, we need to fine-tune your artwork.

## To customize a more complex miniature, we need to split your artwork to reflect its details; Then, make a separate mold for each part; Finally, assemble them together with glue.

## Miniature with a simple structure, there is no need to split your artwork.

## 2. Product Cost

## The price of the product depends on the miniature ejection method: single-cavity or multi-cavity.

## So, the exact quote is based on your artwork, the file format requirements are STL, OBJ, and STP.

## 3. Design Artwork Fee

## We can help customers to draw artwork and charge the corresponding fee according to the difficulty level.
