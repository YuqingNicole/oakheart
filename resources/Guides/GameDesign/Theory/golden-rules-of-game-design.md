### Golden Rules of Game Design

Last week I pitted a simple question to a whole bunch of amateur and professional game designers across twitter:  
  
> Game designers, for an article I'm writing: What are your golden rules of game design? Full credit will be given!
>
> — Robin David (@robindavid\_dice) [September 7, 2015](https://twitter.com/robindavid_dice/status/641034490853367808)

  
  
In the bunch of direct tweets that followed, I asked them to share one tip they would like all other designers to take note of. Some designers responded through tweets, and some through direct messages, so pardon the unusual formatting that follows.  
  
I was going to write a more in-depth piece, going over each issue, in a similar way to my [Game Design Deadly Sins](https://www.robindavid.info/2015/08/game-design-deadly-sins.html) article from a couple of weeks back, but honestly, many of these designers say it better than I ever could! So here are their responses, in no particular order.  
  
  
  

## Focus Your Core Mechanics and Simplify

## Playtest and Pay Attention to Your Playtesters

Randy was kind enough to elaborate for me in a direct message:  
> After your game is (more or less) working, the best feedback you can get comes from \*watching\* players play it. Are they having fun? What makes them frustrated or confused? Do they look fully engaged and invested in the outcome? When do they disengage from the game and check their phones? Does anything cause them to smile or even laugh out loud? What part of the game takes longer than it should? Are the components the right type and shape and size?
> For the best results, you need to watch people \*other\* games too -- not just your games. I know watching people play isn't as fun as playing yourself, but you really need experience watching people play lots of games. When you have a lot of experience watching games, you can better understand what you see when you watch people play your games.

  
> [@robindavid\_dice](https://twitter.com/robindavid_dice) I have things I keep an eye on, like muscle memory. Watch initial confusion, watch pacing, watch number of decisions.

In part, Geoff is talking about mechanics such as "skip a turn", and other lame moments in gameplay.  
  

## Play Lots of Other Games

## Consider Your Components Early On

  
[David J Mortimer](https://twitter.com/mortispur)  
> IMO: Publishers very keen on keeping component costs down. Find ways to get multiple uses from each component. For example use card backs, double sided tokens etc.

## Pay Attention to Your Rulebook

> Always blindest your rulebook. And get someone unassociated with the game to edit it. Always include an annotated graphical representation of the setup and game components.

  
Many thanks to all the designers that responded with their thoughts!

   Great list of tips! I particularly like Daniel Solis' tip, to offer choices between safe & predictable vs risky & chaotic. It's not something I had considered before, yet fits with something I have been thinking about recently, on the value of randomness for creating tension and increasing the emotional reward for the player when they pull something off. Do you have a favourite tip? Or one that resonates particularly strongly? (they are all great tips after all!)

     [Robin David](https://www.blogger.com/profile/16603128790228748017)[20 September 2015 at 01:27](https://www.robindavid.info/2015/09/golden-rules-of-game-design.html?showComment=1442737643424#c827076066401311301)

     I like quite a few of them - the ones that resonate most are about cutting the clutter and getting to the core of the game.  
       
     A few are just valuable good practice, like prototype early and consider your components.  
       
     @toddderscheid comment about making large changes in each iteration is interesting as I've always done the opposite - such as changing the numbers just a little to see how things go. But when I think about it, this could be a really useful exercise in itself and could send your game in so many interesting directions.

     Yes! Performing big changes to a prototype is really quite scary... especially to a game that is going ok. I mean if a design falls flat I'd have no problem but with a game that feels close to working it takes quite a leap! Certainly something to consider!
