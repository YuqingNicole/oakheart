# The Long Haul Project: Why Making Games Takes a Long Time

In the frozen Canadian arctic of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, there is a famous road known as the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road. It’s a long haul road for ice truckers that’s over 300 miles long and most of it is built on frozen lakes. Sometimes it’s hard to know which direction to go in, but by far, the hardest part is that there is a limit to how fast you can go – 16 miles per hour. When I heard about this, I said to myself sardonically “sounds like game development.”

Testing, manufacturing, shipping, and building an audience all take a lot of time and there is no way to really shortcut this. Whether you work 20 hours per week or 60 hours per week, you cannot meaningfully reduce the amount of time it takes to do certain tasks. Manufacturing and shipping can’t be changed at all by extra work. Testing can be expedited, but only as fast as you can afford to bring in fresh testers or make changes to the game. With building an audience, sooner or later, you will run into some kind of constraint…

You can spend money on ads, but only until you run out of money. You can talk to more people, but only until you run out of either people to talk to, energy to talk to people, or – in the case of things like Twitter or Instagram – you hit an API limit set by a web developer. You can bring up your game multiple times, but only until people get sick of hearing about it. You can keep talking, but only as long as you have things worth saying.

Game development…no, creativity itself, requires a mix of commitment and downtime. In fact, I’d hoped to speak about this on a post about mental health with a real licensed psychiatrist on this very blog. That post fell through after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and left my contact without power for months. (He’s physically okay but was unable to respond to questions.)

You can’t speed run this. A single project, even with a large team of creators and administrators will still need to go through several stages, listed below. Let’s imagine you have infinite staff and money at your disposal. Where will you hit a bottleneck?

* Early Game Design: If you’ve got tons of game designers and you work in shifts where 2-3 designers are working on a game 24/7, this will take **several days**. You can’t have much more than 6-9 people working on game design or else communication will get really weird, really fast.
* Artwork: Let’s say you create great art specs and break discrete parts of the game up between artists. This will still take **a few****weeks** because each artist will have a contract, some will flake on you, and some will not meet the spec.
* Game Tweaks: Let’s say you have an infinite supply of fresh play-testers. Yet every time you make a new tweak, you’ll have to iterate the game. Even with 24/7 shift work, it will take **several****days**to get this right.
* Sample Production: You’re going to have to have another place print your game. If you know exactly what you’re doing when you make the order and you have it rush shipped, this is a **two week**process.
* Reviews: Once your game is ready for review, go ahead and wait **six weeks** for reviewers to get back to you. They’re busy and do their work with full-time jobs and kids most of the time. You can’t rush them because you need their trust to continue on.
* Kickstarter: Okay, you don’t technically need Kickstarter, but a lot of people like using it to estimate demand and have some degree of certainty in success. Take **two weeks**for a short campaign.
* Manufacturing: Let’s say you start the print run as soon as the Kickstarter ends and front the cash even while waiting on the Kickstarter check to clear two weeks after the campaign. It will take **six weeks**to print and **two weeks**to air ship it. (Most people can’t afford to air ship, and sea shipping takes up to three months).
* Fulfillment: Let’s say you rush ship all your rewards from the warehouse – that’s a **two week**process.

Without factoring in sales and marketing, it is not even *theoretically possible* to create a board game and fulfill it in less than six months of time. This is assuming you have tons of staff and tons of money, which very few of us do.

What I’m driving at is simple: *if you work alone or in a small team**, be patient, pace yourself, and have fun*. You can’t sprint a marathon. You’re not missing out on anything by *not* working yourself to exhaustion. There are structural limits to how fast you can move.

If you get bored along the way or feel like you’re not making enough money, here are some suggestions:

1. Stagger your game projects so that you’re working on more than one at a time.
2. Launch another project or start a different business entirely.
3. Help other creators make something they’re proud of.
4. Spend time with your friends and family.
5. Take a vacation.
6. Binge watch YouTube. Yes, seriously.

I don’t even think business geniuses like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet could build up massive empires from nothingness in a year or two. They could do it again and probably do it in less time than it took the first time, but if they were truly left with nothing but their knowledge – no contacts, no cash – it would take a while to build back up to where they are now.

Let’s put the myth of the obsessed genius creator in the ground. The most effective creator is the passionate one who puts in consistent effort regularly BUT who does not burn out or isolate themselves in the process. The effective creator takes in the world around them, reaches out to others, and generally *lives* a life outside of their work.

**Most Important Highways & Byways Updates**

* I’m chugging along on the final 100 tests. I’m feeling good about Highways & Byways. I’m on track for the late March Kickstarter I’ve been aiming for.
* It looks like I’ll be getting the prototype game in the mail today!
