This is awesome Jamey. I appreciate the perspectives on Greg’s feedback and how engaging folks outside of our areas of focus can bring great insights.

To answer your question, one thing I did early on was ask lots of questions when others made “shiny promises”. For perspective: I own a tiny design company and have created one indie game that’s received good press. I’ve invested almost 10 years in its success so far.

Well, as an exhibitor at cons, small in-person events, and online, I’ve met several well-meaning folks who contacted me to propose some great-sounding lucrative deals. As creators and business owners, researching such offers is vital.

Of the four entities that offered to back my game or license it in some way, zero are still in business.

Thanks again for sharing this content Jamey!
