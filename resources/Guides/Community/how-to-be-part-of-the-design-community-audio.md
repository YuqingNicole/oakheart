First, thanks for the feedback! We're glad you're enjoying the podcast and very cool about finding a meetup in your area!  
  
Typically, the Libsyn RSS feed is where you will get episodes the quickest. The previous episode you are talking about had a hiccup that I didn't notice until getting ready to post a new episode; especially since it downloaded to my podcatcher, etc... But that is a rare case.  
  
TGC spaces out their news for SEO reasons and so they don't spam. So sometimes it will be a week or more before they post about a new episode.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Jeff
