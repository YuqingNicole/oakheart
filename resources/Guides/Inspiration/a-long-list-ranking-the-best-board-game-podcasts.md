Are you a podcast addict?

Do you listen to everything from how to better your life to bio-hacking your body and everything in between?

You are in the right place. If that doesn’t sound like you, but you’d still like to listen to educated people talk about board games, you really are a geek.

It’s all good. So are we.

We have spent many an hour with our earbuds in, listening to the ramblings of other people in the board game industry. We have taken many recommendations from family, friends, and strangers on the internet on what to listen to. Us Hexagamers got together to discuss which we thought were the best board game podcasts around.

As per usual, we had some disagreements and debates about which one should take the coveted Top Board Game Podcast spot. As we started making a list, it was if there was a seemingly endless list of podcasts available. We didn’t stop there, we got online and researched for even more. Trying to find those underground gems for you readers.

Unfortunately, our list got to more than 50 different podcasts and there was no way we could listen to all of them and make a fair judgement on if there was some that deserved to be higher on the list. So for now, we will make a few sections, and modify this list over time.

The list will be our favorite board game podcasts, mixed in with the views of those on the interwebs. The top 3 on the list are your heavy hitters that everyone seems to know about and love. You will recognize their names, and have probably watched a YouTube video with them in it.

When making the list we wanted to include something for everyone from the beginner board game player, to hard-core players, to designers. We factored in things such as how often they produce episodes, is the production quality good, are the hosts entertaining with good chemistry, and of course the length of these shows.

We hope you can find something you like here! We would also LOVE to hear your opinions on what you think are the top rated board game podcasts!

# Best Board Game Podcasts

## 1. The Dice Tower Podcast

![Dice Tower Podcast](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dice-Tower-Podcast.jpeg "Dice Tower Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 475 + | 1 h 30 min |

This board game podcast is great, and at the top board game podcast for a few reasons. The hosts, Tom Vasel and Eric Summerer, are names you might recognize if you have done any research in the board game world. They have been around the industry for a really long time. Don’t believe us, check out some of the dates on their YouTube Channel, or the fact that they have over 500 episodes!

These podcasts focus on everything from Question and Answers sessions, to reviews, to news. There is pretty much no topic in the board game world they won’t touch. They are very informative, and very well produced. In fact, they have a whole network of podcasts under their belts.

The two hosts sometimes bring on guest hosts to help keep content fresh. It helps make sure the show is good for newbie board game players and for experienced players as well. They have a good back and forth between them, and have good senses of humor.

They reference other games very well so you can find other games you might like. These informative guys are also family men, so they add the family perspective in from time to time.

This is the one stop for a lot of listeners, and we know why.

## 2. Shut Up and Sit Down

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Shut-Up-and-Sit-Down.png "Shut Up and Sit Down")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Irregular (2-3 Weeks) | 60 + | Hour |

If you’re familiar with the industry, you know another huge player is Shut Up and Sit Down (SUSD). They have a massive and loyal following, and for good reason. The hosts Paul and Quinn, are well known for their honest reviews of games on their website, and especially on their video channel.

This podcast is very well produced. It is one of the podcast that does a great job balancing between being informative and being entertaining. In fact, we would go so far as to say they have a major focus on keeping things entertaining for its audience. Either that or they just get lucky, a lot.

Unfortunately this show isn’t produced on a regular basis like some of the others on the list. This is something that is important to some listeners, but not others.

If you think you are a little bit interested, go have look at their hilarious episode titles and you will probably get sucked in. They keep that humor going throughout the show, all while having a meaningful discussion. The discussions include game reviews, news, and general thoughts on board games, all around an hour or so long.

It’s one you can subscribe to and get excited when you see a new episode show up in your app every once in a while. It is one of the best podcasts about board games out there.

## 3. The Secret Cabal

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Secret-Cabal-Gaming-Podcast.png "The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg)~~​~~ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bi-weekly | 150 + | 2 h 15 m |

This may be the fastest growing podcast on our list of the best board game podcasts you can listen to. It has started to come up in discussions more and more often. It might be because of the fact that they put out an episode biweekly. Yes, you read that correct, plenty of content here.

They are 5 old friends that all have very unique viewpoints and perspectives on board games. To add to that diversity, they also cover a huge range of genres. Everything from Deck Building Board Games to Cooperative Board Games to Card Drafting Board Games.

The podcast is high quality, with over 150 episodes produced at the time of writing this post. We find it to be very entertaining, while at the same time thoughtful. It seems like you can find yourself sharing common thoughts/grounds with at least one person on the show.

The Secret Cabal is your go to podcast if you want to fill your ears with lots of content. Not only are there a lot of episodes to choose from, but most of the episodes are fairly lengthy. We’re talking up to 3 hours, lengthy. Some may find this a bit too much, but if you just want something to listen to in the background while doing other stuff, this is the perfect fit.

## 4. On Board Games

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/On-Board-Games-Podcast.jpg "On Board Games Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 250 + | 1 h 15 m |

On Board Games is another good podcast about board games that has been around for a long time. This podcast is another one that falls under the Dice Tower Network. As usual with these games in this network, this one is of high quality.

This podcast tends to follow a very regular format including round table discussions and reviews. They say it better suited for the gamer who has a bit more experience, but it still lends itself well to the beginner board game player as well.

They also have a very handy rating system for games (Red, Yellow, Green), so if you are just looking for the quick and dirty, they can do that too.

Again, the variety of topics and games they cover is huge, so you shouldn’t get bored with repetitive content like some podcast provide.

They also have a regular posting schedule going of once per week, with the average length of podcast being anywhere between 1-2 hours. It really depends how stuck/in depth they decide to get on a game in this one, which is a good thing.

Check them out for some good consistent listening.

## 5. Boardgames To Go

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Board-Games-To-Go-Podcast.jpg "Board Games To Go Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Irregular (Monthly) | 175 + | 1 h |

Another great board game podcast with a long history is Boardgames To Go. When we say long history, we mean that this thing started back in 2005! Though, in the past couple of years his pace of posting new podcasts has slowed down.

He markets himself as ‘occasional and opinionated’ which is very true. Sometimes there are months in between shows. Normally this would be a downfall on our checklist of top board game podcasts, but his longevity is key here. Mark, the host, can go in spurts of posting, mainly due to his busy schedule.

The variety from episode to episode is one of the major reasons why we like this one. He can range from talking about a couple board games the whole episode, to covering a bunch of them. Boardgames To Go also talks about whole genres of games, like wargames. He also brings on guest-hosts regularly which helps to keep things fresh and give you a different viewpoint on games.

Expect anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours per episode, with the average being roughly 1 hour and 15 min. He even talks about upcoming and past board game events, so the content doesn’t get stale.

If you’re looking for a good board game podcast with history to it, this is the one. We hope with a few more subscribers he will start putting out shows more regularly.

## 6. Heavy Cardboard

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Heavy-Cardboard-Podcast.png "Heavy Cardboard Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 150 + | 1 h |

Looking for a podcast that focuses on some of the heavier and lengthier board games? This is the one you want. This podcast concentrates on those games that can take anywhere from a few hours to days to play.

We as the Hexagamers don’t play a lot of these types of games, but that doesn’t mean we don’t enjoy them. We also know that a bunch of you, our readers, LOVE these games.

The hosts, Amanda and Edward, are very highly educated when it comes to these bigger games. These Euro style games can be intimidating for some, so they break things down well. The hosts focus on in game mechanics, strategy, and some of the planning and choices you will need to make during the games.

They have a variety of formats for the show, which helps keep things interesting. Obviously they have episodes dedicated to reviewing specific games, but it goes beyond that. They also spend time interviewing game designers, talking about conventions, and spending some time conversing about the mechanics in games.

Another plus for this podcast about board games is that they post on a regular basis. They have over 75 episode, but probably just as many podblasts (random posts that aren’t called episodes) on top of that.

As with some of the other good boardgame podcasts, they bring on guests host to help keep conversations flowing, and multiple opinions. Check them out if heavy gaming is your thing or if you just want to try out something different.

## 7. Blue Peg, Pink Peg

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blue-Peg-Pink-Peg-Podcast.jpeg "Blue Peg, Pink Peg Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bi-weekly | 100 + | 2 h 15 m |

If you are looking for something a little lighter and maybe a little more wholesome (we use this term loosely~~​~~), then Blue Peg, Pink Peg is a good place to try.

This cast used to feature two couples (hence the blue peg, pink peg), that discuss all things board games (not that unlike us here at Hexagamers). They will hit topics such as mini reviews of games, in depth reviews, news in the gaming industry, events, etc. in their bi-weekly shows. This group does a good job at staying consistent in their producing and are up over 100 episodes now.

What we like about this good podcast about board games is that they keep things light and funny. We find the hosts very relatable and down to earth (which can be said about a lot of people in this industry thankfully). Not to mention they are pretty funny.

It is pretty common to find this group arguing over a topic one minute and then laughing at themselves the next. They have been known to go off on weird tangents from time to time. This takes away from the show for some people, but it’s up to you personally if it bugs you or not.

Something about the way they argue, talk about their everyday lives, and relationships that really give you the feeling of knowing them, and thus trusting their opinions if they seem similar to how you are in life.

They do his a few games per episode usually, as well as news, so they can run for 2-3 hours with an average being just over an hour. For some laughs and advice in your board game world, check them out.

# Best Board Game Podcasts for Reviews and Beginners

## 1. Dukes of Dice

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Dukes-Of-Dice.png "The Dukes Of Dice")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 150 + | 1 h 30 m |

D~~​~~ukes of dice is a great board gaming podcast that has been around for a few years. They date back to 2014 and have over 150 episodes to their name.

These Dukes cover a good range of topics, but the majority of their time is focused on reviewing games, making it great for beginners (Check out our Best Board Games for Beginners post for some of our suggestions). Now, if you think you are well versed and might not get anything out of this podcast, think again.

These guys cover a big variety of games, good for any skill level, but not only that, they touch on board game news in almost every episode. This can range from kickstarter games to new expansions slated for release. They also tackle topics like the board game awards and much anticipated conventions.

They have very good banter, as well as great discussions. Expect to spend anywhere from an hour to two hours listening to them.

The other things these guys do well is keep a regular schedule of weekly production. The last thing of note why we like this podcast is their ‘lookbacks’. They are in a good habit of reviewing some of their previous work/discussions and seeing if their opinions have changed. It’s nice to have these flashbacks and evolution over time.

Be sure to check these guys out, and head over to their website for some great supplemental information.

## 2. The Five By

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Five-By.jpg "The Five By")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bi-weekly | 15 + | 27 m |

Here is a new board game podcast you might not have heard of. This team has only been doing shows since January of 2017. They produce a show every other week, and are up over 15 so far, which may not seem like much, but read on as to why it is.

The Five By is known to do rapid fire podcasts. This usually consists of each host takes a turn reviewing a particular game in short form. Yes, this means they review 5 games every episode! So if you are looking for board game reviews, this one is putting in the work.

When we mention short form, we mean that each review is about 5 minutes long, making the total podcast 25-30 minutes long in total. This is a great size for consuming on the commute to/from work.

These well-spoken hosts are great at conveying their thoughts in a short amount of time. A quick heads up, they can be a bit tricky to find on iTunes since they are so new (at least at the time of publishing this list). They are worth the listen if you want to get through a lot of reviews in a little amount of time.

## 3. The Long View

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Long-View.jpeg "The Long View")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg)~~​~~ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Irregular (Weekly) | 125 + | 1 h20 m |

If you are looking for a good board game review podcast with a different viewpoint, this is the one. The reason it is called The Long View is because they play games a bunch of times before giving it a review.

They do a great job on discussing the board games in depth, touching on some points that others might miss. They also note on things that have changed since the first few plays of the game, which is a great perspective.

Expect the episodes to be between 20 minutes and 2 hours, with the average length being about 1:20. They also post fairly regularly, but we don’t know the actual schedule. We do know that they have over 125 episodes you can enjoy.

Primarily they focus on one game per episode so that they can really dive into the details of the game. One of the beauties of this cast is that they cover a lot of older games, as one might expect when you hear they play them a bunch of times. You might be researching older games and looking for an in depth review. Chances are, these guys have you covered!

The Long View is a nice change of pace from the “this is the new game we tried this week” podcasts that give you bad cases of FOMO. They might be a great fit to keep your mind occupied while mowing the lawn!

## 4. Perfect Information

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Perfect-Information-Podcast.png "Perfect Information Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 75 + | 1 h |

Perfect Information is something we all want during a good board game, but alas, it is rarely there. The hosts of this podcast try to help alleviate that problem… or at least talk about it.

This show takes a bit of a different twist when looking at board games. Yes, they still talk about specific games, giving their thoughts and reviews on them, but it’s more than that. They go into everything you should consider when playing games… Things you might not even be aware of.

These guys talk about things like frustration during games, or are you having fun because you made it fun or it was actually fun, and even about the different genres of games. Like we said, not your typical topics, and for that it earned a spot on our best board game podcasts for beginners list.

The episodes of the show have a few different formats. Some are interviews, some talk strategy, and some the mentality of board gaming. All in all, they keep from getting stale with such varied content.

Expect episodes to vary widely in their lengths. Everything from 5 minutes to 2 hours. They do keep a pretty regular weekly schedule though, and have over 75 episodes out there (maybe more, it’s hard to count).

Add this one into you rotation for something different, even if you’re not a beginner you will probably get something out of it. We did.

## 5. Board Game Royale

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Board-Game-Royale.jpg "Board Game Royale")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 25 + | 23 m |

The podcast, Board Game Royale,~~​~~ is another newer player on the block. Having only been around since the end of January 2017, they only have 26 episodes. Which is a lot less than some of the others on the list, but it doesn’t make it any less great.

This (almost) weekly podcast takes another different twist on the board game review podcast. What they do, is pit two games against each other in a head to head battle. They try to pick games that are similar in nature. Whether this is because they are both train games, or maybe they share the same game mechanics.

They usually start with the basics of how each game is played, and then give their thoughts on the game. Finally comparing the two games and debating on which one is the better of the two.

Comparing two games in no easy task, and is something that you could debate for hours on end. I know what you’re thinking, listening to people argue for hours on end sounds like a terrible time, well they make sure it’s not. In fact, the make sure to limit each podcast to an average of just over 20 minutes, with a high end around 30 minutes. Keep in mind, they don’t go too deep on this one, so if that’s what you’re looking for, head elsewhere.

They do a good job of keeping things light and funny. This is a good one if you are debating between two different board games on which to buy. It might not be the exact two you are comparing, but it is a great way to understand how some new games work. We think it is an interesting way to get your reviews of board games via podcast.

# Best Board Game Podcasts for Designers and Developers

## 1. Ludology

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ludology-Podcast.jpg "Ludology Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 155 + | 1 h 15 m |

The Ludology podcast is one that very easily could have made it to the Best Board Game Podcasts list, but we decided to move it here instead. This one is a highly rated podcast among the community.

They market themselves as the podcast that “talks about the how’s and why’s of board games” instead of focusing on news and reviews. That’s exactly what they do, and the do it well.

The hosts cover an assortment of topics in this show, but primarily focus on one area at time. Some of the time they discuss these topics with each other, sometimes they will bring in guest hosts to help them in the conversation. These guests are usually people that have been in the industry for a number of years and/or have some expertise in an area.

They look at topics like tie breakers and if they are important, or possibly even the scoring tracks in the game. They give a good perspective on these since they have played so much games. We found ourselves realizing things that we had never even thought of before. A sign of a good board game podcast.

They also look at specific games and analyze them, not so much from a review, but more of a dissection of the game. Or even how a game got to where it is today.

Ludology has been around for more than 150 episodes, all of which are roughly an hour to an hour and a half in length. Plus they put one out every week, so check them out for some regular thoughts.

## 2. Board Game Design Lab

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Board-Game-Design-Lab-1024x1024.png "Board Game Design Lab")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | 75 + | 45 -60 m |

Here is another good on for you designers. It is hosted by Gabe Barrett, who brings on some very reputable guest hosts to help him along the way.

This podcasts for designers and developers covers a huge range of topics that should be of interest if this is your thing. In each episode you can find them focusing their attention on some area of the game such as graphics or having good AI. They even focus on genres themselves sometimes, such as solo games.

A lot of the episodes feature the hosts interviewing/discussing these topics with prevalent people in the board game industry. This gives you a good view point from experts in that certain topic. Usually you can come away with one or two hidden gem tidbits! Not to mention, they usually do short little ‘Bonus’ episodes where they talk about the previous show.

Look for these episodes to be anywhere from 45 minutes to a little over an hour, with an average time of about 55 minutes. They come out weekly (Wednesdays), which is nice, plus have a 10ish minute bonus episode on Fridays. We didn’t count how many episodes there are, but estimate it around 75+.

This one is usually very informal in nature, and they don’t have a much for wasted time in them. We like the “Lesson’s Learned” portions.

## 3. Breaking Into Board Games

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Breaking-Into-Board-Games.jpg "Breaking Into Board Games")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approx Bi-weekly | 50 + | 45 m |

If you are looking for a good board game podcast that focuses on interviewing people of note within the industry, then this is the one you are looking for.

These guys have over 50 episodes worth of interviews to choose from. We know you won’t chose and will mass consume these if that’s your deal. No worries there, they are packed with good content. They average around 45 minutes long and come out every 2 weeks or so.

They cover a wide range in this cast. They talk about everything from development all the way to marketing and sales. Yes, they can help you almost every step of the way through the process. It is a great resource. They even go into details such as event planning to publishing company setups. So much valuable information that you may not have even realized you needed.

The interviews also spend some time with the interviewee letting you know how they got to where they are today, and some of the ups and downs along the way.

The style of this one makes it very easy to put on in the back ground while you do stuff around the house, but it also lends itself to a focused listener who wants to get the most out of the show.

Check this one out for some good information and to learn a little bit about some people in the industry.

## 4. Board Game Business

![](//hexagamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Board-Game-Business-Podcast.png "Board Game Business Podcast")

| Frequency | Episodes | Length (Avg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Irregular (2-3 Weeks) | 60 + | 20 m |

The title of this podcast perfectly explains what their expertise is; Board Game Business. This is another one for people who go beyond just designing and developing board games, to the people that are trying to make this a full fledge business.

You can find some great topics covered here. They spend some time talking about social media and how to grow your fan base. Other topics include making how to play videos for your game, selling on amazon, and of course it wouldn’t be complete without talking about Kickstarter!

It is full of really useful information for anyone trying to make money with board games. This one isn’t so much for designers and developers maybe as much as producers. However, we know that if you are into making games then you might be wearing all of those hats!

This one comes out semi-irregularly with episodes coming every 2-3 weeks usually. Sometimes they go once a week. The average for the shows is right around 20 min, and there is over 60 of them at the time of writing this post.

So, if you are looking for some valuable tips on finding artists to pricing and distribution, and everything in between, then give the Board Game Business podcast a listen.~~​~~
