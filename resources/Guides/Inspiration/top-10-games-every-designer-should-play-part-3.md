#### FINAL ADJUSTMENTS

Before we reveal the *“Top 10 Games Every Designer Should Play at Least Once”* for **Stonemaier Games Design Day 2014**, I wanted to mention two additional factors:

1) **Round 2, 15 points.** League members were shown the top 10 list and given a week and an additional 15 points to add to any titles. The goal was to allow minor fixes with group consensus. For example, there were no worker placement games that actually made it in the top 10 (due to splits of the vote), so many of us used our 15 points to throw support on those titles. Funny enough, we were still divided on WP titles, and again none made it! We debated if we should edit the #10 spot and force it, but we left it alone.

Notably, only one title shifted out of the top 10 in round 2. *Resistance* at #10, dropped out and #11*Forbidden Desert* jumped in all the way up to #6.

I also attempted my own *Diplomacy* experiment and secretly corresponded with Leaguers to vote up *Dead of Winter*, managing to get it from rank #47 to rank #15! I’ll admit that may have corrupted round 2 data a bit, but I digress…

2) **Jamey Stegmaier’s input.** Jamey was given final edits on the list, and he made two key changes on #9 and #10. Firstly, and perhaps expectedly as a publisher of fine worker placement titles, he fixed our worker placement issue by taking the top ranked game in that genre (*Stone Age*) and placed it at #10. He dropped a personal favorite of his, *Magic: The Gathering*, which admittedly didn’t fit the time constraints of this event. Secondly, he dropped *Acquire* due to personal taste and design philosophies and saw fit to put a superb tile placement game in it’s place, *Carcassonne* (which did very well in subsequent BGG polling).

**Without further ado, the TOP TEN Games that Every Designer Should Play\*:**

> #1 – DOMINION

10 League nominations. *[Designer: Donald X. Vaccarino](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/10525/donald-x-vaccarino "Donald X Vaccarino on BGG")*

#### FINAL THOUGHTS

Thanks for reading this series! Thanks especially if you voted and submitted a top 10 on our first post. We appreciate everyone’s list of top games they would recommend. Here’s something I learned along the way, worth mentioning: **There is no right answer** to the top 10 games question.

There’s 70,000+ games out there, and **every one of them has the potential to teach you a lesson in game design**. Maybe it’s a lesson that only *you* need to learn, and not for someone else due to genre or play style. That’s ok.

Maybe it’s a positive lesson, or a negative lesson, or a lesson that only comes out after multiple plays. Maybe it’s a game on the BGG top 100 or not ranked at all yet. It’s all good. Many of us became quite passionate about the games on our own lists, and the BGG list tells me that people value games for a variety of reasons. A key lesson (for me) turned out to be:

**Play many games, and be open to the lessons that they have to teach.**

I wanted to extend a sincere thanks to Jamey Stegmaier and **[Stonemaier Games](https://stonemaiergames.com/ "Stonemaier Games")** for the invitation to select the events at this event, and to the League for embarking on this adventure.

We wish the best to the designers attending the Design Day, and we look forward to playing the games that those designers will produce!
