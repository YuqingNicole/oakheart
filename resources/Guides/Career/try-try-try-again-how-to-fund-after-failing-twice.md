As someone who is getting into board game design coming from a background in marketing and service design, I find this trend to use Kickstarting as a market research tool interesting and a bit strange as well. I hear more and more creators talk about launching and relaunching campaigns as a way to gauge customer interest and gain feedback. That’s great – but I wouldn’t be so sure that Kickstarter is the best way to do it.

For example, I heard Stephen Buonocore of Stronghold games talk about this on Board Games Insider when re-launching the campaign for Aftershock by Alan Moon. That’s no little indie publisher, and certainly no indie designer :) It’s great that they adjusted, re-launched and funded (again), but all I could think was: have they done no user research to find this out BEFORE going to Kickstarter? Launching a campaign seems time consuming when you could just do some user testing to gain those insights.

Stronghold perhaps have the resources to “waste” an attempt, but for indie game creators it seems super frustrating and time consuming.
