If I went back to give myself advice it would be to be okay with changes. Pull back on our egos. We all are proud of what we created and we know we need tweaks but try out different ideas from play testers. Take on things at first we as designers may not think to much of. Over time, many times years, it will be amazing to see how the game progressed into the greatness that it is today. Good luck everyone with your designs.
