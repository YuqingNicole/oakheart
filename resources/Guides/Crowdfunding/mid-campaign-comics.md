## Mid-campaign comics

The middle of a crowdfunding campaign can be a challenging time and you will always want things to share and talk about.

One of my favourite mid-campaign strategies is to work with [Semi Co-op](https://www.semicoop.com/), who make comics about the board gaming hobby.

I’ve worked with them now for 3 different Kickstarters and have always been happy with the results.

For The Isle of Cats we created a 3 part series that released over multiple weeks.

For Don’t forget the Kittens! we added a 4th part to the story.

For Race to the Raft we experimented with more of a hybrid of “being in the game” and “playing the game” to provide more of a gameplay overview while keeping the fun narrative.

I’ve always been happy with the results and recommend having a content release strategy in place before launching your campaign to keep things exciting!
