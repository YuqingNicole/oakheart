## Miniatures as an option

11th October 2022 4

Miniatures in crowdfunded board games have become increasingly popular over recent years as we see projects exploding with backers wanting to get the figures.

If you look over the highest funded projects on Kickstarter you’ll notice the majority are packed with miniatures and it makes a lot of sense, they add to the cost which in return adds to the amount raised.

I see a lot of creators trying to find ways to include miniatures as they know it’ll help them make more money and get people excited.

Personally, I’m of the mindset that miniatures should be optional and while they can be a fantastic deluxified bonus, they don’t always need to exist. This is why with The City of Kings, The Isle of Cats, and Race to the Raft I’ve continued to offer them as an optional upgrade.

It may not be the way to make the most money, but I think it’s a great way of letting customers decide what is important to them and how much they wish to spend.

Perhaps you could give it a try next time you’re planning miniatures for a project.
