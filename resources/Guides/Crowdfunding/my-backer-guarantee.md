## My backer guarantee

29th September 2022 3

In recent times crowdfunding has become too risky for some people to use as a few projects have started requesting more money prior to fulfilment.

It typically goes like this:

You pledge $80 on a brand-new game, pay an additional $30 for shipping, and wait around a year for it to arrive. Then, just when you are expecting it at your door you get an email asking for another $25 as something has gone wrong, and you’re now left with a dilemma.

Do I spend another $25 to get the thing I already paid $110 for and have waited on for a long time, or do I say no and hope I get a refund. The decision is made worse as in most cases the refund is for a lower amount than you originally paid, it is a no-win situation.

This can occur when there are major unexpected changes to prices or when a company has just gotten their numbers wrong.

### My guarantee

I have full confidence in my processes, believe in my numbers, and most importantly want my backers to know that I will deliver upon my promises. The process of backing a game on Kickstarter should be a joyful one and to that end I’ve decided to put a guarantee on my upcoming Kickstarter.

I believe in providing the best experience possible for my community and to me a part of that means taking ownership of the risks associated with a project. Afterall, it’s thanks to my community that I get to make games and I will never forget that.

I look forward to discussing more thoughts on this in the future.
